        <p>Hi!</p>

        <p>I'm Adriana Sandoval Salamanca. I'm 39 years old. I served a full-time mission in the
            Peru Lima
            Central Mission when I was 25. I returned home 13 years ago, and four months later I
            married a man
            who is very dedicated to the gospel and who encourages me to be better. That's why I've
            started
            studying again, even at my age.</p>

        <p>We have two children, a boy and a girl. Unfortunately, due to health problems, I
            couldn't have any
            more children, but we are still happy amidst life's challenges. I really enjoy watching
            movies with
            them, laughing, and playing; those are my favorite moments.</p>

        <p>This is a path that, although difficult for me, I feel I will be able to complete my
            studies this
            time.
